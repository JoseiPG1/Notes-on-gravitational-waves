# Notes on gravitational waves

This are my personal notes related to gravitational waves and also
I am including the presentation series from the weekly meeting. The 
idea is to make a repository containing all the relevant information
that is going to be necessary for my PhD research on gravitational waves
and the parity breaking symmetry.

Meetings topics
- [x] 10-03-2025, vacuum gravitational waves and degrees of freedom.
- [x] 17-03-2025, computation of the gws and gauge invariants.
- [x] 24-03-2025, gws equations using a FRW background.
- [x] 31-03-2025, solutions to the gws equations and polarization tensor basis.
- [x] 07-04-2025, properties of the polarization tensor basis, left and right basis polarization.
- [x] 14-04-2025, parity breaking symmetry, arxiv 1912.06104v2.
- [x] 22-04-2025, parity breaking symmetry Chern-Simons gravity.
- [ ] 29-04-2025 $\to$ 02-05-205, starting two research projects, data analysis and theoretical framework.

To be done
- [ ] Field equations of the Chern-Simons gravity action.
