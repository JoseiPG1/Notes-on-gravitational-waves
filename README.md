# Notes on gravitational waves

This are my personal notes related to gravitational waves and also
I am including the presentation series from the weekly meeting. The 
idea is to make a repository containing all the relevant information
that is going to be necessary for my PhD research on gravitational waves
and the parity breaking symmetry.
